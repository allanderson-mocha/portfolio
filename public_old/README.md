# About This Portfolio
I've completed a good number of projects — and many more are on the way! Unfortunately, my resume can only showcase so much.

So what's the solution?
Do what every coder eventually does (whether seriously or not): build a portfolio website.

This site presents my most notable projects, complete with detailed descriptions and visuals, to give a full picture of my skills and experience.

As a bonus, this portfolio is a project in itself! Why? Because as an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, my front-end web development skills have historically been a weak spot.

To close that gap, I built this website completely from scratch — no templates and no prior experience in front-end. I:

- Set up an Oracle Cloud server to host the site using Node.js

- Registered my own domain

- Wrote everything in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The process has been a deep learning experience as I explore modern web development tools and best practices to complement my engineering background.

### Current Version: v0.22
The site currently includes:

- Access to my resume

- GitHub links for three projects

- My LinkedIn and GitHub profiles

- A contact form to email me directly

And there’s a lot more planned.
